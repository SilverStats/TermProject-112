TermProject-112
===============

Code for my 15-112 term proejct from fall 2013. This will only work on Windows computers because of the directory structure I created. (Compatibility was not the focus of the project; rather, creating a polished product was.)

To run locally, download all files, and then run URL Interface.py. This will download the necessary Retrosheet programs and files to your computer and may take a few minutes. You need an internet connection for this part.

Next, run Screens.py to start the program. All other files are accessed from Screens.py and do not need to be run individually.

For simplicity, this will only download play-by-play files from 2010 onwards. Using all of Retrosheet (back to the 1940s) takes a long time to set up, which is not the goal.
